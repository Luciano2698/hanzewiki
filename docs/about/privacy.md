# Privacy

## What you need to know

Unless you set `log_messages` to `false`, Discord Tickets stores the content of every message sent within a ticket channel, including attachments etc. The message authors' ID, username, display name, discriminator, avatar hash, and top role are also stored. The name and colour of roles is stored. Message content and user and role names etc are encrypted before being stored. This data is stored for the purpose of the archives feature.

## What you should do

You may need to update your privacy notice to inform your members that their messages (even deleted ones) are stored on your server.
